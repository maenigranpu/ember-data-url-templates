If you have a Toyota car with a DVD navigation system model NDCN-W55, you may have encountered the "Insert Map Disc" error message when you try to use it. This error occurs when the system cannot read the map data from the DVD disc, which may be due to a corrupted or missing file. Fortunately, there is a free solution for this problem that does not require you to buy a new map disc or pay for a service fee.

The solution involves downloading and burning a file called LOADING.KWI, which contains the data needed for loading the DVD player. You can find this file online from various sources, such as [this forum post\[^1^\]](https://www.pakwheels.com/forums/t/insert-map-disc-free-solution-for-toyota-dvd-nddn-w54-w55-w56-w58/215552) or [this SoundCloud track\[^2^\]](https://soundcloud.com/eliseevdwko/toyota-ndcn-w55-navigation-dvd-japan-2005). Make sure you download the correct file for your model, as different models may have different file names and sizes.
 
Once you have downloaded the LOADING.KWI file, you need to burn it on a blank CD-R or DVD-R disc using a software that can create a bootable disc. You also need to give the disc a specific name according to your model. For NDCN-W55, the disc name should be 86271-V416A8. Do not create any subfolders on the disc, just put the LOADING.KWI file on it.
 
After you have created the disc, insert it into your DVD player and wait for it to load. The system should recognize the disc and start working normally. You can then remove the disc and use your original map disc or any other compatible map disc. You may need to repeat this process every time you disconnect your battery terminals or reset your system.
 
This solution should work for most Toyota DVD navigation systems with similar models, such as NDDN-W54, NDDN-W56, NDDN-W58, NSDN-W59, and NSDN-W60. However, some models may require a different file or a different method. For example, for NSDN-W59 and NSDN-W60, you may need to use an SD card instead of a CD or DVD disc.
